            <p> <em>Game Setup</em> is Leeds' most popular board game caf√©. Our knowledgable and enthusiastic team are available to ask any questions of or to make recommendations. We aim to create a friendly, welcoming space for seasoned gamers or those new to the hobby, where they can explore our catalogue of games. As well as games we also serve a wide variety of drinks including craft beer, coffees & teas plus a refined food menu. You are welcome to purchase any games that you enjoy playing or we can work with you to source a copy of something that you are after. This service is unfortunately only available in the cafe at present but we are working with our
            developers to build a function within this website where you can both browse and purchase games that we stock. You're welcome to pop into the cafe to make an enquiry or an easy way to secure a table for your friends or family is to use
